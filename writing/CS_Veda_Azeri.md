You run the local used bookstore in Backwater, and you absolutely love your
job. You're a bit of a bookworm yourself, and being surrounded by the creaky
shelves full to the brim with stories is just how you like it. Often, when
there aren't very many customers, you choose to curl up next to the fireplace
rather than stay at the counter. Nothing feels better than a nice mug of coffee
and a good read. You're never short of books, and you can always find something
new and exciting buried in a shelf somewhere.

The bookstore isn't exactly normal; however. You'd never let anyone else find
out, but you don't actually get your books from anywhere. They just have
a tendency to appear on the shelves - never when someone you're watching, but
you know that it's happening. The store provides a nice selection of books:
most are fairly normal, like childrens books or popular novels, but every once
in a while a book shows up that is very rare, or very valuable. Rarer still,
some books appear which are decidedly abnormal. Around half a year ago, you
encountered a tome that seemed to be bound in some kind of leather, but when
you picked it up it was warm, and you could feel it pulsating. Older still,
probably at least 3 years ago, you got one that seemed to be watching you, even
though it clearly had no eyes. Whenever these strange books show up, you make
a point to get rid of them immediately by burning them in the fireplace. After
all, if someone found one in the store, who knows what would happen?

Encountering those books is always an unpleasant experience, but the fire makes
it better. You really enjoy burning things, to an unhealthy degree really. THe
beauty of the flames as they slowly, delicately consume all they come across is
one of your favorite things to watch. You've had these desires since you were
a child, but you always fought them off until recently. A few weeks ago,
however, the craving got especially strong, and you decided to give in to it.
You picked the old house on the hill, abandoned for generations. It was
a victimless crime, it's not like the place was important anymore. Watching the
flames consume the entire mansion was the most sublime experience you have ever
had; the destructive wrath of nature erupting around the old wooden foundations
and spreading ever upwards - it scratched your itch better than anything ever
had. It eventually wasn't enough, and you ended up burning down a little hut in
the woods. Of course it wasn't as good, but there's only so many structures you
can burn down without hurting someone, so it will have to do for now.
