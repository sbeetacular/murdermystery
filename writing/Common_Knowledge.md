# A Poisoned Peace: Common Knowledge

![](../resources/fog_vignette_2.jpg)

## General Information

    It's summertime in the idyllic little town of Backwater. The warm sun 
encourages children to leave their homes in favor of biking down the streets,
splash around in their little kiddie pools, or, a town favourite, race boats 
they've constructed down the river in the local park. Because school's been let
out, everyone from the university has returned home to enjoy their time away from
a mountain of assignments and catch up with their childhood friends. The trees lining
the streets flutter in a soft wind that keeps the temperature just perfect for sitting
outside the local ice cream parlour, and to visit their old haunting grounds.
  
   At least, that's how it was, before everything went to shit. It started a few weeks
ago, when the first reports of children never coming home were filed. Worried parents
and friends would comb the streets for hours, and the police sent out reports that started 
searches in all the nearby towns. None of them ever showed up.
    
    In the meantime, more and more went missing, and soon enough, the parents started vanishing too.
A thick, heavy fog rolled into town as people became more and more frantic, now not only worried 
about the ones who were already gone, but also who would go next. They tried to keep the town 
functioning normally: delivering mail, meeting up with friends, and letting restless children out
to play (though naturally under much closer supervision). Most people went missing during the night,
and soon, an unspoken curfew was placed on the town to hopefully stop the losses. It didn't stop
anything. Beds used the night before would be found cold and empty, meals were found left
nearly untouched, children's boats were found stuck in enbankments, and overstuffed mailboxes became
frequent sights around the town.
    
    Some people believed that an organisation was kidnapping people on a large-scale, despite
never being able to give a reason why so many people would be taken from the same area in a short
amount of time. The more fatalistic were inclined to believe that some horrible mass-murderer had 
been unleashed in their town, taking the victims to some secret location that made it nearly impossible
to find the bodies. Others, still, turned to more paranatural explanations. The House on the Hill, the
grand building that had stood their as a symbol of the town since it's founding, had burned down not long
before the disappearances started. The fire department had been treating it as a case of arson (before all
of them went missing, that is), and some members came to believe that a spirit had taken up residence there,
and was pissed their home was destroyed. Rituals were done at the site of the house to try and appease whatever
spirit might have been there, but the disappearences didn't let up.  

    Now there's only a handful of people left in town. The police are gone, families are almost
entirely broken up, and no one's been able to find anything that would give any information about
where they've all ended up. Tensions are high, and the remaining members of the town, certainly 
unwilling to brave another night alone, have all consolidated in the local church. Desperate, scared,
and unsure of what their future holds, the survivors are determined to make it through the night. What
they'll do when morning comes; however, is an entirely different matter. 

## Characters

### Professor Béla Drašković

If Backwater had an aristocracy, the Drašković name would be first
among them.  The family was there when the town was founded, and due to current
events may very well be there when it ends.  Drašković is proud of his heritage,
and he'll be damned if he lets anyone forget about it.  Drašković has no
real political inclination, though, instead choosing to teach classics at the
local college.  Drašković loves old books and fine wine, and has both in
plenty. A bachelor by choice, Drašković lives with his aging and sickly mother
in the old family manor.

### Callie Myers

Callie seems one of the happiest people here. Satisfied enough to play with her
dolls by herself, she doesn't seem upset about her parents disappearance.
Honestly, it might be for the best. Callie's tantrums are not what anyone needs
tonight.

### Soren Ryker

Notoriously 2kewl4skewl, Soren runs with the cool kids at Backwater High.
Usually literally, from the town police assigned to truancy duty. Soren often
finds himself injured when his older brothers visit, sporting anything from
ugly bruises to broken bones. He's too cool to care though. Sometimes Audrina can
be found hanging around him, but it's not like he's gonna let anyone know what
he thinks about that.

### Veda Azeri

Veda runs the used bookstore in town. An eccentric woman with a sharp wit,
Veda can often be found curled up next to the fireplace in her store, a book
in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other. Although she mostly keeps to
herself (as much as anyone can in a small town like this), she is well liked by
those who frequent her shop, both for her personality and her seemingly
miraculous penchant for finding obscure books.

### Father Ezra Lehrmann

Lehrmann is the town's priest, and has been since before anyone here can
remember. Kind and gentle, Lehrmann is seen as a father figure by many, and
is often sought out for advice. People know that his church is a place they can
always come to feel safe and secure, which is why everyone is gathered here
now.

### Lily McCallister

Lily is the perfect student, and daughter, and friend. She never misses
a class, she keeps her room in perfect order, and she maintains a bright and
cheery personality even when things get rough. Whether it be tutoring after
school, raising money for charity, or volunteering at the local hospital,
Lily is always happy to lend a hand. These last few days seem to have been
getting to her more than most, however.

### Audrina Glen

A precocious young girl with an interest in medicine, Audrina spends a lot of her
time out in the woods, and most of the rest with her friend, Soren. The two
make an unlikely duo, to be sure, but they both take care of each other in
their own unique way. While Audrina is intelligent for her age, she still acts
like a child most of the time, and has been in a rather foul mood for the last
few weeks. Hopefully, it will blow over soon.

### Ashton Corliss

Ashton's a smart kid. And an incredibly active one.
He always seems to be on the move, whether it's for his
job delivering mail or his frequent camping trips. Ashton's
well known among his peers as being someone you can turn to
for advice. 

### Oscar Rayn

Oscar is a strong kid. He used to wrestle, and probably could have made nationals
if he hadn't quit 2 years ago. He spends most of his time either hanging out
with Killian or working on his whittling. Although a little bit tempermental,
Oscar has a good heart and he hates seeing people treated unfairly.

### Killian 'Flash' Walker

Corvana's nephew Killian loves to run, and he is extremely good at it. He spends
most of his time far away at college, which he got into on a sports
scholarship, but he is home for the winter holidays. He speaks fast too - often
to fast for his thoughts to keep up with, resulting in frequent but accidental
rudeness. He always makes up for it, though, often with a plate of homemade
cookies or something equally delicious.

### Rowan Archer

Rowan only began going by her name when she came out as trans 2 years ago.
Her transition has made her seem a lot more confident in herself, but
it hasn't really made her any more outgoing. Always the shy girl, Rowan
tends to avoid verbally answering when possible. She loves reading and
playing soccer, though she tends to prefer solo drills over the actual game.

### Madelyn Corvana

Corvana runs a prognostication service from her home. She also makes 
her own herbal tea mixes from the plants she grows in her garden.
Corvana is good friends with Veda, and frequently visits her shop.
She's generally well liked in the town, especially by the kids, who
she always seems to have just enough candy for.
