## Characters

### LONGFELLOW

If Backwater had an aristocracy, the LONGFELLOW name would be first
among them.  The family was there when the town was founded, and due to current
events may very well be there when it ends.  LONGFELLOW is proud of his roots,
and he'll be damned if he lets anyone forget about them.  LONGFELLOW has no
real political inclination, though, instead choosing to teach classics at the
local college.  LONGFELLOW loves old books and fine wine, and has both in
plenty. A bachelor by choice, LONGFELLOW lives with his aging and sickly mother
in the old family manor.

### ZOE

ZOE seems one of the happiest people here. Satisfied enough to play with her
dolls by herself, she doesn't seem upset about her parents disappearance.
Honestly, it might be for the best. ZOE's tantrums are not what anyone needs
tonight.

### PETER

Notoriously 2kewl4skewl, PETER runs with the cool kids at Backwater High.
Usually literally, from the town police assigned to truancy duty. PETER often
finds himself injured when his older brothers visit, sporting anything from
ugly bruises to broken bones. He's too cool to care though. Sometimes MISSY can
be found hanging around him, but it's not like he's gonna let anyone know what
he thinks about that.

### VIVIAN:

VIVIAN runs the used bookstore in town. An eccentric woman with a sharp wit,
VIVIAN can often be found curled up next to the fireplace in her store, a book
in one hand and a mug of coffee in the other. Although she mostly keeps to
herself (as much as anyone can in a small town like this), she is well liked by
those who frequent her shop, both for her personality and her seemingly
miraculous penchant for finding obscure books.

### RHINEHARDT:

RHINEHARDT is the town's priest, and has been since before anyone here can
remember. Kind and gentle, RHINEHARDT is seen as a father figure by many, and
is often sought out for advice. People know that his church is a place they can
always come to feel safe and secure, which is why everyone is gathered here
now.

### HEATHER:

HEATHER is the perfect student, and daughter, and friend. She never misses
a class, she keeps her room in perfect order, and she maintains a bright and
cheery personality even when things get rough. Whether it be tutoring after
school, raising money for charity, or volunteering at the local hospital,
HEATHER is always happy to lend a hand. These last few days seem to have been
getting to her more than most, however.

### MISSY;

A precocious young girl with an interest in medicine, MISSY spends a lot of her
time out in the woods, and most of the rest with her friend, PETER. The two
make an unlikely duo, to be sure, but they both take care of each other in
their own unique way. While MISSY is intelligent for her age, she still acts
like a child most of the time, and has been in a rather foul mood for the last
few weeks. Hopefully, it will blow over soon.

### BRANDON:

BRANDON's a smart kid. And an incredibly active one.
He always seems to be on the move, whether it's for his
job delivering mail or his frequent camping trips. Brandon's
well known among his peers as being someone you can turn to
for advice. 

### OX:

OX is a strong kid. He used to wrestle, and probably could have made nationals
if he hadn't quit 2 years ago. He spends most of his time either hanging out
with FLASH or working on his whittling. Although a little bit tempermental,
OX has a good heart and he hates seeing people treated unfairly.

### FLASH:

ZOSTRA's nephew FLASH loves to run, and he is extremely good at it. He spends
most of his time far away at college, which he got into on a sports
scholarship, but he is home for the winter holidays. He speaks fast too - often
to fast for his thoughts to keep up with, resulting in frequent but accidental
rudeness. He always makes up for it, though, often with a plate of homemade
cookies or something equally delicious.

### JENNY:

JENNY only began going by her name when she came out as trans 2 years ago.
Her transition has made her seem a lot more confident in herself, but
it hasn't really made her any more outgoing. Always the shy girl, JENNY
tends to avoid verbally answering when possible. She loves reading and
playing soccer, though she tends to prefer solo drills over the actual game.

### ZOSTRA:

ZOSTRA runs a prognostication service from her home. She also makes 
her own herbal tea mixes from the plants she grows in her garden.
ZOSTRA is good friends with VIVIAN, and frequently visits her shop.
She's generally well liked in the town, especially by the kids, who
she always seems to have just enough candy for.
