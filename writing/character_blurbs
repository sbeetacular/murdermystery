BRANDON's a smart kid. And an incredibly active one.
He always seems to be on the move, whether it's for his
job delivering mail or his frequent camping trips. Brandon's
well known among his peers as being someone you can turn to
for advice. 

ZOSTRA

ZOSTRA runs a prognostication service from her home. She also makes 
her own herbal tea mixes from the plants she grows in her garden.
ZOSTRA is good friends with VIVIAN, and frequently visits her shop.
She's generally well liked in the town, especially by the kids, who
she always seems to have just enough candy for.

JENNY

JENNY only began going by her name when she came out as trans 2 years ago.
Her transition has made her seem a lot more confident in herself, but
it hasn't really made her any more outgoing. Always the shy girl, JENNY
tends to avoid verbally answering when possible. She loves reading and
playing soccer, though she tends to prefer solo drills over the actual game.
