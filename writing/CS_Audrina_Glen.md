You've been interested in medicine for as long as you could remember. Your
parents gave you a toy doctors kit when you were little, with a bunch of
anatomical models and surgery clothes and such. You haven't been able to get
enough of it since. You love figuring out puzzles and fixing things, and you
love showing off how much you know about the human body.

That desire to show off has led you to taking on a bit more than you think
people would really appreciate, however. Your experiments have gotten more and
more ambitious over the last few years. You've set yourself up a nice little
laboratory (really it's just a little hut in the woods, but it serves your
purposes well enough), and youve managed to ~~steal~~ borrow a few knives and
bandages and other things, and acquired a few test subjects as well -
squirrels, frogs, and the like. You love seeing how all the little pieces fit
together, and you love learning everything that you can.

You'd like most of all to be able to learn from a human subject. Not to dissect
someone, of course (well, you'd kind of like to, but only if you were really
mad). You spend a lot of time with Soren, and he sometimes lets you tend to
him when he gets hurt, but he's never gotten hurt worse than a sprained ankle.
If you could poke around someone who was seriously injured, in the name of
medical attention, that would be ideal, you think.

Your little experiments aren't all fun and games, though. Even though you're
very intelligent for your age, there is still a part of you who is a regular
child, and that part of you gets very scared by the things that you see. Even
though you are always fine during the day, your nights are oft haunted by
visions of your failed experiments coming to life and turning on you. You know
this is ridiculous, of course. You could never actually reanimate the dead...
Probably. Certainly not with the knowledge you have right now, anyways. And not
that you would want to, either (Unless you were really mad).

A few weeks ago, something happened that really set you off: Somebody burned
down your laboratory. You have no idea who it was, but when you find out,
they're going to have hell to pay. You had lots of good stuff in there, and
now its all gone. Ashton spends a lot of time in the woods, so maybe he saw
something.

**Secret:** You like disecting animals and 'experimenting'

**Goals:**

1. Find out who burned down your lab, and punish them.

2. Heal someone who is fatally wounded, so you can learn about human anatomy.

3. Keep Soren safe. Your friendship is strange, but you do care about him.
