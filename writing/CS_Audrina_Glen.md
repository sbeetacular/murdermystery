You've been interested in medicine for as long as you could remember. Your
parents gave you a toy doctors kit when you were little, with a bunch of
anatomical models and surgery clothes and such. You haven't been able to get
enough of it since. You love figuring out puzzles and fixing things, and you
love showing off how much you know about the human body.

That desire to show off has led you to taking on a bit more than you think
people would really appreciate, however. Your experiments have gotten more and
more ambitious over the last few years. You've set yourself up a nice little
laboratory (really it's just a little hut in the woods, but it serves your
purposes well enough), and youve managed to ~~steal~~ borrow a few knives and
bandages and other things, and acquired a few test subjects as well -
squirrels, frogs, and the like. You love seeing how all the little pieces fit
together, and you love learning everything that you can.

You'd like most of all to be able to learn from a human subject. Not to dissect
someone, of course (well, you'd kind of like to, but only if you were really
mad). 

**Secret:** You like disecting animals and 'experimenting'

**Goals:**

1. Find out who burned down your lab.
