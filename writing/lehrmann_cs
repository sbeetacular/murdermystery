    It's not too difficult to be known by everyone in a small town like Backwater,
especially if you're essentially the town's spiritual leader. Religiously,
you're not really beholden to one denomination, but that seems to work out
in your favor. Almost everyone feels safe approaching you, and you've heard
people around town mentioning that 'father' is more than just a term of
respect to them. Hearing people talk like that makes you immensely happy.
You've always been driven to help people and because of that, you feel like 
you've achieved your ideal life.
    At least, that's how you felt. Even before this whole mess started, something
started feeling off about your life. People have been thanking you for advice that
you don't remember giving, or sometimes you try to confirm plans only to be told
they didn't know what you're talking about. There's gaps in your memory too. It's
usually just an hour or so, but it's gotten up to a week before where you can't 
remember anything you did during that time. 
    You've never been able to tell anyone what's going on. If nothing else, you're
highly aware of the effect you have on the people here. Were anyone to find out that
you weren't e
    That's what makes the current situation so much worse for you. Everyone that's
left is here now, in your church, and there's absolutely nothing that you can
do for them. But even more than that, you're terrified that you'll blank out again
during this time of crisis. What you'd say or do while your mind seems to be shut off
is beyond you, and you'd give anything to be sure that, at the very least, you didn't
make the situation worse than it already is.
